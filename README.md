This project aims to model the spread of an infectious disease using the SIR model/graph (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered). The SIR model uses a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe the dynamics of how individuals in a population transition between being susceptible, infected, and recovered. By analyzing these transitions, we can estimate and model parameters over time to analyze the progression of the disease. This project will include both theoretical and practical components, with a focus on the use of ODE's!
